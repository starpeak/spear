Spear
=====

Spear (StarPeak Extended ActiveRecord) is a Ruby on Rails plugin that provides
the most needed things like delete flag, versioning and I18n support.

I know there are many different plugins that do exactly the same things - but it
is always a pain to combine them.

At the moment there is only delete flag support, but more will follow soon.


Installation
============

Just as any plugin here on github:

script/plugin install git://github.com/starpeak/spear.git


Examples
========

Delete Flag
-----------

To use delete flag extension you just add one line to your model:

class Page < ActiveRecord::Base
  spear_delete_flag

  # Your model as used to be
end

At the moment you will have to add a column 'deleted_at' to your model in an
migration you have to write. This will be improved soon.
